## Summary

All commit messages should be of the general style:
    
    <type>: <description>

Where `<type>` is one of `fix`, `feat`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, or `test` and `<description>` is a plain-text message.

## Introduction

Wax lyrically to the point.

## Inspired by

* [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
* [Angular Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
* [Auto Changelog](https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/auto-changelog)

## Whathappened Commit Message Format

Whathappened expects git commit messages in the format outlined below:

    [optional breaking ]<type>[ optional (<scope>)]: <description>

    [optional body]

`<type>` is recommended to be one of:

    fix
    feat
    build
    ci
    docs
    style
    refactor
    perf
    test

Variations on these types like `feat, feature, features`, or `doc, docs` are seamlessly grouped together.

`<scope>` is recommended to be a module, file, or folder name as appropiate.

For a nice summary of `type`s and what they mean, please see [Understanding Semantic Commit Messages Using Git and Angular](https://nitayneeman.com/posts/understanding-semantic-commit-messages-using-git-and-angular/).
